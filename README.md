I am win32 elsewhere online, but win32ss (win32 subsystem) here.  I created the Vista Extended Kernel, patched out the "other half" of Code Integrity on Windows Vista
and generally develop in C(++). I also have experience in Java and x86/x64 assembly (moreso analysis than development in the case of the latter).

Lightweight, highly compatible win32 applications are my focus. After all, what makes an isometric 2D DX12 game better than a isometric 2D GDI or DX6 game?
