I am win32 elsewhere online, but win32ss (win32 subsystem) here.  I created the Vista Extended Kernel, patched out the "other half" of Code Integrity on Windows Vista
and generally develop in C. I also have experience in Java and x86/x64 assembly (moreso analysis than development in the case of the latter).
